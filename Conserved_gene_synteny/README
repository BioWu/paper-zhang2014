Abstract:
--------
	The pipeline and input files are used for quantifying and comparing synteny in birds relative to mammals, which mentioned in 
			Manuscript Section "Conserved gene synteny"
		and 
			SOM3 "Conserved gene synteny".

Usage:
------
    The shell scripts must be running in order to compare synteny of birds and mammals using the following sequence:
		To start with running "01.Birds/Call.OSBs.sh" and "02.Mammals/Call.OSBs.sh";
		next, run "03.Result/Merge.OSBs.sh";
		finally, run two R scripts (i.e. "03.Result/Boxplot.ave.div.data.R" and "03.Result/Both.ave.div.data.R"), respectively.

Structure & Description:
------------------------

This directory includes four subdirectories listed as follows:
	1. bin/	# contains the perl scripts;
	2. 01.Birds/	# contains input files and statistical results of syntenic blocks of any two birds;
	3. 02.Mammals/	# contains input files and statistical results of syntenic blocks of any two mammals;
	4. 03.Result/	# contains final merged result and plots;

	To run this pipeline, firstly, you need to provide a species name list (i.e. "species.list"), gff files, a file including divergence time between any two species ("i.e species.list.div") and corresponding orthologous gene files. 
	Then these perl scripts stored within "bin" directory would identify synteny from each pair of two-avian/mammalian genomes and examine the fraction of orthologous genes based on syntenic and best reciprocal blast matches.
	Lastly, all statistical results come from 22 birds and 22 mammals would be merged and modified to generate plots (Fig 2D).
