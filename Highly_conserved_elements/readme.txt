The conserve and nonconserve model should be estimated first to run PhastCons.
The file "maf-file.list" contains all the multiple sequence alignments (MSA), which
should be in the format of MAF. All the MSA files should copied or linked into
the local directory.

When the MSA files are prepared, the commondline "sh work.sh" will complete
all the tasks from generating the conserve and nonconserve model to estimating
estimating genome conservation at single nucleotide level as well as
generating the lists of highly conserved elements (HCEs).
It's however recommended to take separated steps to do so. And some steps may
require large memory and take quite long time.


The mammalian MSA were downloaded from UCSC (18-way placental mammal whole
genome alignments). To keep consistency and make the results more comparable, 
we used the same 'rho' value as that in birds (rho=0.2506). THe mammalian
nonconserve model ("mammal.noncons.mod") was also downloaded from UCSC, and the
conserve model ("mammal.cons.mod") was generated by scaling the nonconserve
model with rho=0.2506.

The strategy to prepare mammalian MSA files is the same as for avian MSA. But
used the script work.mammal.sh instead of work.sh.
