Abstract:
--------
	These files are shell and perl scripts used for identification of large segmental deletions mentioned in
   		 	Manuscript Section "Large segmental deletions in avian ancestral lineage" 
		and 
			SOM2 "e) Identification of large segmental deletions (lost syntenic blocks) in the modern birds".

#########
Usage:
------
	Run "Identification_of_large_segmental_deletions.sh" to get lost syntenic blocks

Description:
------------
	The pipeline can do the whole work, from calculating the ratio of lost ortholog pairs (LOP) to super-large windows (i.e. lost syntenic blocks). Fistly, You should provide orthologous gene file to "Identification_of_large_segmental_deletions.sh".


	There are mainly 10 steps for identification of large segmental deletions and 2 more step, returning the results accordingly. These steps are:
	0) provided orthologous gene list/file;
	1) calculated the ratio of lost ortholog pairs (LOP) of genes (using overlapping 5 consecutive genes with a step size of 1 gene);
	2) chose the windows (with >= 0.8 LOP in ostrich);
	3) chose the windows (with < 0.5 LOP in at least one of the two non-avian reptiles);
	4) merged windows;
	5) built psuedo super-large windows;
	6) returned the results accordingly;
	7) obtained right super-large windows;
	8) marked super-large windows;
	9) picked up original window;
	10) sorted out these super-large windows in coordinately order;
	11,12) returned the results accordingly.
