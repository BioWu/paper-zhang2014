This directory is about the pipelines used for protein-coding gene annotation.

STEP 1 ('01.chicken_finch_ortholog):
This step is to define a high-quality set of reference genes from the
published chicken and zebra finch annotations for subsequent homology-based annotation.

STEP 2 ('02.gene_prediction'):
This step is to do homology-based annotations and combine the evidences from
multiple sources into an integrated gene set.
